[advanced]
# Avanced area, don't touch this if you don't know what you are doing!
# Advanced settings are ok by default!


# Camera will look at the center of the vehicle plus this offset. 
# Negative values will make the camera look at back side of the vehicle (only noticeable when turning/drifting)
# Positive values will make the camera look at front side of the vehicle (only noticeable when turning/drifting)
# Modify this setting with caution.
#
# Values: 	between -1.5 to 1.5 (other values are supported, but behaviour may be unpredictable)
# Default: 	-0.25
lookFrontOffset = -0.25

# Same as above (but for low speed) 
# Negative values will make the camera look at back side of the vehicle (only noticeable when turning/drifting)
# Positive values will make the camera look at front side of the vehicle (only noticeable when turning/drifting)
# Modify this setting with caution.
#
# Values: 	between -1.5 to 1.5 (other values are supported, but behaviour may be unpredictable)
# Default: 	-0.4
lookFrontOffsetLowSpeed = -0.4

# How fast the camera matches the vehicle rotation
# The lower the value, the smoother the rotation is. 
# Too low values may be difficult to see where the vehicle goes
# Modify this setting with caution.
#
# Values: 	between 0.1 to 1.5 (other values are supported, but behaviour may be unpredictable)
# Default: 	1.0
cameraRotationSpeed = 1.0

# Same as above (but for low speed) 
# The lower the value, the smoother the rotation is. 
# Too low values may be difficult to see where the vehicle goes
# Modify this setting with caution.
#
# Values: 	between 0.1 to 1.5 (other values are supported, but behaviour may be unpredictable)
# Default: 	0.4
cameraRotationSpeedLowSpeed = 0.4

# Camera movements and rotations are pre-smoothed out by this value
# The lower the value, the smoother the camera movement and rotation is. 
# High values may make the camera follow the vehicle movements too hardly.
# Modify this setting with caution. This one very rarelly needs adjustment
#
# Values: 	between 0.1 to 0.5 (other values are supported, but behaviour may be VERY unpredictable)
# Default: 	0.1
generalMovementSpeed = 0.1

# Camera will be pushed up by this value.
# Positive values will make camera look down.
# Negative values will make camera look up. (this is probably not desired)
# Values higher than 0.2 pushes camera too up, useful for drifting. Values above 0.5 doesn't make sense in most cases.
#
# Values: 	between 0.0 to 0.4 (other values are supported, but behaviour may be undesired)
# Default: 	0.1
